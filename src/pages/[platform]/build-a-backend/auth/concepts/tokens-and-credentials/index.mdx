## Token Revocation

[Amazon Cognito now supports token revocation](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/06/amazon-cognito-now-supports-targeted-sign-out-through-refresh-token-revocation/). This means that the Cognito refresh token cannot be used anymore to generate new Access and Id Tokens.

Access and Id Tokens are short-lived (60 minutes by default but can be set from 5 minutes to 1 day). After revocation, these tokens cannot be used with Cognito User Pools anymore. However, they are still valid when used with other services like AppSync or API Gateway.

For limiting subsequent calls to these other services after invalidating tokens, we recommend lowering token expiration time for your app client in the Cognito User Pools console. 

Token revocation is enabled automatically on new Amazon Cognito User Pools, however existing User Pools must enable this feature, [using the Cognito Console or AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/token-revocation.html).
