There are multiple ways you can implement upload functionality for your app and upload files to your storage bucket.

<Block name="Storage Manager UI Component">
Upload files from your app in minutes by using the cloud-connected Storage Manager UI Component. You can further customize the theme of this component to better fit the aesthetics of your app.
